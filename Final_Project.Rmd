## Data Source and Workflow
# The data source is from the World Bank. Data science workflow applied in this project is DSEMN. Obtain, scrub, explore, model and interpret. 

## Obtain the data 
# The data is from world bank and upload the data into github. Then load the data into R.

data <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JennierJ/Final_Project/master/Total%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.csv"))

## Scrub and explore the data

# From the table, we can clearly see that these is a trend of increasing total emission of greenhouse gas with the year.

## Modeling and Interpret

ggplot(table, aes(year, mean, group = 1, col="red")) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Greenhouse Gas Emission", title = "Total Greenhouse Gas Emission vs. Year")

# Conclusion: Greenhouse gases from human activities are the most significant driver of observed climate change since the mid-20th century. According to
# the graph, the total emission of greenhouse gas is increasing as the year.
